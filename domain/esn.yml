    - text: ESN (Erasmus Student Network) is an organisation made up of volunteers - students and alumni - who help international students who come to Prague for their Erasmus exchange. We help them get used to being in a new city and make new friends by organising plenty of events for them as well as being there for their questions about life in Prague.
