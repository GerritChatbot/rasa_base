        Erasmus in Schools (EiS) lets exchange students at Charles University share their culture with young people at Czech schools.
        All you have to do is to register, prepare a session and then present it. Don't worry, we will be there to help and guide you during the process.
        It's a unique way to promote understanding and cultural awareness! Both teachers and students at these schools are extremely grateful for each
        such presentation.
